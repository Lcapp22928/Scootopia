# Scootopia
Scootopia is an open-world racing game where you scoot around a college campus performing death defying stunts on you guessed it... a scooter. 



Ride around the open world to start race missions where your goal is to get to the top of the leaderboard by zipping through the checkpoints as fast as possible. 



Be careful, if you run into an obstacle or fail a trick you will ragdoll and need to respawn!
